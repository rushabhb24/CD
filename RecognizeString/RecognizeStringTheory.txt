Theory

Regular Expressions: Regular expressions (regex) are a powerful tool for matching patterns in text. In this program, you'll be using a simplified form of regular expressions to match patterns like 'a*
', 'a*b+', and 'abb.'
String Matching: String matching involves comparing a given input string with a specific pattern to determine whether they match. This program focuses on matching strings based on the provided patterns.

Algorithm:

1. Initialize a state variable to keep track of the current pattern.
2. Iterate through the input string character by character.
3. Update the state based on the current character and the current state.
4. If the state transitions reach a final state (indicating a match), consider the input string as matching the pattern.
5. If the state transitions lead to an invalid state (indicating a mismatch), consider the input string as not matching the pattern.
